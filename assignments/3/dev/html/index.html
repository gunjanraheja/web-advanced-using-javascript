 <h2> "EXPLORING POST-INTERNET ART" </h2>
 <br>
<br>

In the early 2000’s, Marisa Olson conceived art “after” the internet – to be aware, celebrate, critique and consume the internet conspicuously. Germinated from the dada, fluxus and net art movements, the Post-internet era explores the ramifications of the internet on art, culture and society. The term is something to explore and discover based on its interpretation by artists, curators, critics and net artists. Today, the internet is seen as a necessity and influence on everyday life, creating a network to connect, contribute, learn and share. Users produce and consume, and most importantly give their unique opinions blatantly.
<br>
<br>
“Exploring Post-Internet Art” draws together eight artworks of new media artists, curators, critics, theorists, conceptual artists, performance artists, contemporary artists and internet artists. They explore the internet by raising individual responses and opinions towards the social, economical, political or cultural factors of the society. Through their performances and mediums, they individually define their interpretations of the post-internet art movement.
<br>
<br>
The illumination of post-internet art is best portrayed in artworks by Olia Lialina and James Bridle. Lialina’s <i> My Boyfriend came back from the War (1996) </i> is an interactive, visual and conceptual artwork with sequences of hyperlinks narrating a story with images and text. It is a conversation between a couple reconvening after war. <i> Bridle’s awarded Dronestagram (2012) </i> is a social website pressurizing the government for absolute transparency. It has received online attention with thousands of followers. It displays satellite images of areas subjected to drone attacks building an ethical connection between foreign landscapes. The artworks are presented in the exhibition as online archives.

<br>

Other works display the exploration of different mediums and interpretations. Petra Cortright’s <i> VVebcam(2007) </i> portrays the effects and states of watching video online. The artwork inserts a series of animations to the live video with background music. The main highlight is the passive surveillance of the video screen, reflected by the viewer’s experience instantly. Cory Arcangel’s <i> Fuck Negativity (2015) </i> takes the approach of designing a new clothing line. More than the brand, it is about making a line of positive attitude and inspiration for today’s gravers. He states “Life is nothing but a never ending up-hill battle. It is important to keep your head up and moving forward. Gotta stay on it. Lets do this. FUCK NEGATIVITY.” <i> Monitor Tracings(2006)</i> portrays Marisa Olson’s definition of post internet art, to be inspired online and then create something offline. Objects such as headphones or radios are searched on google and traced off the computer onto office paper using a mechanical pencil. The famous French digital and net artist Michael Borras (Systaime) addresses his artworks with Printmaking. He also created Neticones, an interactive website that portrays a mosaic of net icons.

<br>
Lastly, explorations by Seth Price and Michael Bell Smith displays the interpretation of post internet art in different mediums and topics. Price follows the mutability of the internet archive refusing to solidify previous projects. Price’s <i>Dispersion(2002)</i> investigates the significance of distribution – both contemporary art and media. Concentrating on consumption and dispersion, he explores the redistribution of music and sound. He takes a positive view towards life and states: “Sometimes its good to go forward and then double back, and circle around again. To those who turned their feet around so their tracks would confuse their pursuers: why not walk backward?” Being a contemporary artist, Smith explores the use of digital technologies in visual culture. <i> Moving, Endless(2008) </i> are five digital light boxes with digital files. His style is taking familiar visual elements and positioning them within an unexpected conceptual framework. This is presented as a simple online archive in the exhibition.

Jointly, the works in this exhibition explore the unique responses and practices of artists towards the post-internet art era. The main highlight is exploring the significance and interpretation of the “POST” internet era, and how each artist expresses their view in different interesting mediums. The main question to think about is “Are we living in the post-internet era?”. What is interesting is that the term post-internet has still not been thoroughly defined.  Is it being internet-aware? Is it being inspired online and creating something offline? Is it Michael Connor’s definition of working “during, during and during” the internet? Is it conspicuous consumption? Is It of historical significance? Is it McHugh’s era of it being an everyday activity? Or is it the shift in aesthetic practices by comparing the physical and the digital by taking different forms in a gallery? My definition of post-internet art is absorbing the contemporary art, creating individual identities and figures to the things we see around us culturally, socially, economically, and politically in the society.
